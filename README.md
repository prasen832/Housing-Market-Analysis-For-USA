## Overview
The housing market is influenced by the state of the economy, interest rates, real income and changes in the size of the population. As well as these demand-side factors, house prices will be determined by available supply. With periods of rising demand and limited supply, we will see rising house prices.

## Factors Affecting Housing Market
#### 1. Unemployment Rate 
The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labor force.

#### 2. Median Household Income
Household income generally refers to the combined gross income of all members of a household above a specified age.

#### 3. Mortgage interest rate

#### 4. Inflation Rate
Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services rise.

#### 5. GDP per capita
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita shows a country's GDP divided by its total population. GDP per capita provides a basic measure of the value of output per person, which is an indirect indicator of per capita income.

#### 6. Construction costs
Producer Price Index by Commodity for Construction Materials.  

#### 7. Monthly Supply of New Houses
The month's supply is the ratio of new houses for sale to new houses sold. This statistic provides an indication of the size of the new for-sale inventory in relation to the number of new houses currently being sold. The months' supply indicates how long the current new for-sale inventory would last given the current sales rate if no additional new houses were built.

#### 12. Recession
In the United States, a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale retail sales. whenever there is a recession people are more likely to spend less money and this affects the housing market to a large extent.
